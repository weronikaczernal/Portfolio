# About me 
My name is Weronika Czernal. I developed an interest in the IT industry through my husband, who is a tech leader. Currently, I am working towards a career as a manual tester. I am enthusiastic about learning and growing in this fascinating field. On this site, I aim to share all the experience I have gained from my personal studies and research.
