# My project - Filmweb testing project
# Introduction
This project is part of my portfolio, created to showcase my skills and demonstrate examples of my work. As an aspiring manual tester, I have taken the initiative to document test cases and bug reports for a real-world application, Filmweb. This project illustrates my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical application, even in the absence of detailed specifications.
# Project Overview
For this project, I selected the Filmweb website and focused on two functionalities:
1. Adding a film to "Chcę zobaczyć" ("Want to watch") list.
2. Using the search functionality to find movies, TV series, actors, etc.
# Approach 
Given the absence of a formal specification, I explored the Filmweb site to understand how these functionalities work. My assumption was that the site's developers followed certain requirements and specifications. Based on my observations, I made my own assumptions about the expected behavior and developed test cases.
# Demonstrated Skills
* Exploratory Testing: Ability to explore and understand application functionalities without formal documentation.
* Test Case Design: Creating detailed and effective test cases based on user interactions and functional behavior.
* Bug Reporting: Anticipating potential issues and documenting them through bug reports.
# Test Cases 
Here are examples of the test cases I created for the functionalities I tested:
# Functionality 1: Adding a film to "Chcę zobaczyć" list.
